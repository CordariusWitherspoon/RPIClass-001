This repository is for our class. In it you will find a main folder structure of:

Drop/

PickUp/


Inside the Drop/ we will find these directories


Classes/

Exam/

Quiz/

Students/

Resources/


Inside the PickUp/ and Drop/Students/ directories we will find these directories


Bert_Pierce/

Cordarius_Witherspoon/

Elise_Magnolia/

Hadley_Carr/

Levi_Carr/

Max_Smith/

Nate_Carr/

Peter_Magnolia/

Tyler_Pierce/


The Drop directory is where we will find our stuff for the day's class. In Drop/Students/ you will submit any work that you are working on (think of it as your personal directory) DO NOT MESS WITH SOMEONE ELSE'S DIRECTORY.

The PickUp directory is where (if any) grades will be put. Think of grading not in the sense of schooling but in the sense of my comments to you about your work and what I think would be good for you to review or study or get help on.

I hope that you all enjoy this class and learn some things from it.
